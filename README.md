I'm ikyushi, and welcome to my GitHub! Here's where my website code lives, as well as the other millions (at least, that's what it feels like) of repos.

I'm currently a high school student, hoping to be a computer science major or an English teacher (in Tokyo, Japan)

I mainly use Python and the web languages ((S)CSS, HTML, JS).

See ya in the _Repositories_ tab!

With much love,
ikyushi
